Final Message for Replit Developer — Design & UI Improvements Request
Subject: UI/UX Update Required – Login Page, Background, Mobile View, Logo, and Sidebar Issues

Dear Developer,

Thank you for your work on the Call Center CRM System. The project is progressing well, but I have noticed several important UI/UX issues that need immediate improvement to ensure a complete and professional experience, especially across mobile and desktop views.

🔹 1. Login Page Adjustments
Please update the login page with the following:

Move the text “Call Center Management System” to the top-left corner of the page, styled smaller and neatly aligned.

Remove the subtext:
“Streamline your call center operations with our comprehensive CRM solution. Manage leads, track calls, and optimize performance.”

Keep the Achievement badges (500+ Active Agents, 10K+ Daily Calls, 95% Success Rate) in their current position.

Update the background image:

Remove the dark overlay or blur/opacity layer currently covering it.

Use the background image provided by me clearly and visibly, without any masking or filtering.

Keep the login/registration box and all other layout components unchanged.

🔹 2. Mobile Responsiveness
On mobile view, the layout is not optimized:

The left sidebar (menu) after login cannot be minimized or hidden.

This causes major display issues and breaks the mobile user experience.

Please ensure the sidebar is collapsible or toggleable, especially on smaller screens.

🔹 3. Logo Consistency
Across different areas (Login page, dashboards, headers), the wrong or inconsistent company logo has been used.

Please make sure the correct Call Center CRM logo is used consistently:

On the Login page

In the Dashboard (for all account roles: Super Admin, CC Agent, CRO Agent)

In top-right and sidebar areas

🔧 Summary
These issues are small in appearance but significantly affect the usability and impression of the system. I request you to treat them with priority and provide the fixes as part of the next update.

If you need any assets (image/logo) again, I can provide them.
Thanks for your hard work and support.
