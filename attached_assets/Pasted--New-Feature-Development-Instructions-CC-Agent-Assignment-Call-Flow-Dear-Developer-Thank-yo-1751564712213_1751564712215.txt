📦 New Feature Development Instructions – CC Agent Assignment & Call Flow

Dear Developer,

Thank you for your continued work on the Call Center CRM system. To ensure full functionality and real-world usability, we now need the final key features to be developed and implemented as outlined below:

✅ 1. Number Upload & Agent Assignment (Super Admin Role)
Objective:
Enable the Super Admin to upload number lists for each CC Agent individually, using an Excel file.

Required Development:

In the “Number Upload” section:

Keep the current interface.

Ensure the dropdown lists all CC Agent accounts.

Admin selects one CC Agent and uploads an Excel file containing phone numbers.

On Submission:

The numbers must be stored and correctly assigned to the selected agent.

This assignment must be linked by a unique identifier (e.g., agent ID or email).

The assigned numbers will appear in that agent’s Calls Section only.

Additional Improvements:

Show upload history with:

Upload Date

Agent Assigned

Number Count

Add filters:

By CC Agent

By Date

✅ 2. Calls Section View & Actions (CC Agent Role)
Objective:
Allow CC Agents to see, call, and categorize their assigned numbers.

Required Development:

In the Calls Section of the CC Agent role:

Display the numbers uploaded and assigned by Super Admin.

Table Columns:

SL No.

Customer Number

Call Button

Category Dropdown (Busy, No Answer, Switched Off, Not Interested, Interested)

Functional Logic:

Once a category is selected:

That number should automatically delete after 24 hours.

Uncategorized numbers remain in the list.

Add:

Refresh Button → uncategorized numbers show on top

Search bar (by number)

Category Filter dropdown

Pagination (100 records per page)

🎯 Real-Life Use Case:
Admin uploads numbers individually for 5 different CC Agents.

Each agent logs in, sees only their numbers, and starts calling.

After completing a call, the agent categorizes it.

The number gets auto-removed after 24 hours (if categorized).

Leads are added based on call outcomes.

Please implement this as a new feature enhancement, not as a bug fix.
